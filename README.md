# Portfolio_Optimization

This is a Python project that optimizes a set of given stocks using Efficient Frontier as the basis. The program will return the weight of each given stock using the maximum sharpe ratio of the portfolio. It will also use the weight calculated to determine the number of stocks to purchase with a given amount of money.
